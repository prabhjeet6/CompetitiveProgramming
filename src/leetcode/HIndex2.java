    /**
     * Suppose you are given an array of citations sorted in ascending order, for example:
     * [0, 1, 3, 5, 6]. The h-index can be found by checking if the number of papers with at least
     * h citations is equal to or greater than h.
     * <p>
     * For the array [0, 1, 3, 5, 6], the correct h-index is 3, because there are 3 papers with at
     * least 3 citations.
     * Since the array is already sorted, a binary search can be used to find the maximum h-index
     * efficiently in O(log n) time. Here's how it works:
     * <p>
     * Use binary search over the indices of the citations array. We want to find the maximum h where
     * the researcher has at least h papers with h or more citations.
     * Let low = 0 and high = n - 1 (where n is the length of the array).
     * <p>
     * For each midpoint mid, calculate the number of papers that have at least citations[mid] citations.
     * The number of papers with at least citations[mid] citations is given by n - mid (because
     * the array is sorted).
     * Check if citations[mid] is greater than or equal to n - mid. If it is, this means the current
     * paper can potentially be the h-index (because there are n - mid papers with at least
     * citations[mid] citations).
     * If true, this is a valid candidate for h-index, so we continue searching in the left half
     * (high = mid - 1) to check if a higher h-index can be found.
     * If false, we move to the right half (low = mid + 1) to find a larger h value.
